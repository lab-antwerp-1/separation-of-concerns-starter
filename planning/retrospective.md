## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?
Planning went good we worked together and were done quite early on
Our meeting went well

### What parts of your plan did not work out?
I wanted to code more but I am not confident in it
We had lots of linting problems so Darin could not share with us

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?


### Or remove extra steps?
